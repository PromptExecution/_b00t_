# --action-offline-mode
# If you want to speed up running act and using cached actions and container images you can enable this mode.
# stops pulling existing images
# stops failing if an action has been cached and you cannot connect to GitHub
# pulls non existent actions and images
# act will work offline if it has at least ran once while you are online
# get rid of unnecessary timeouts when you have an unstable connection to GitHub or Container registries workaround rate limit problems
