ðŸ¤© gee, umm.. Thanks for the stars!?

this is my personal version of http://github.com/elasticdotventures/_b00t_
my exploration into a 'neo-modern' system tooling, it's a few gb of 'useful'
(and i'll perhaps update it someday when i have time / fully retire)

a strongly opinionated DIFM setup ..

	rich WSL2 ubuntu unix cli, vscode, github + gh cli
	llvm/clang, modern python, rust, k8s, docker (was podman) .. 
	terraform (tofu), azure, aws, g8s, cloudflare
	warning: liberal use of 'neo-modern' unix moreutils, fzf, etc..

you can use this repo as a template and pull in my changes as you wish, 
if curious feel free to open issues for chat & q/a, but consider this is
mostly intended to create a 'nuclear-powered-batteries included'  
for my micro-legion of AI-pairs

# New System: 
see [setup.sh] for minimal bootstrap then `just install`
