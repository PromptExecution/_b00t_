# _pr0j3ct_
ElasticDotVentures is 
a highly opinionated set of tools for deploying Azure Functions, with EV C0r3 libraries, for Google üëæ, Azure ü§ñ.  Extensive use of 1337 speak, emoji "storytell" logging, HSK 1 Chinese Vocabulary.  Azure Durable Functions, Service Bus, KeyVault Configs, ARM/Bicep üí™, check Jargon.md for more info on naming conventions.  Docker üê≥, Python üêç, TypeScript ü¶Ñ - emoji indicates things like designee, consignee, etc. 

# What this Is: ‰∏∫ÊòØÂêó
This is elastic.ventures complete pipeline orchestration system with integrated VS Code development environemnt, CI/CD Pipeline, base system which is suitable for deploying any cloud-scale state-less machine-learning project in frameworks such as PyTorch, Tensorflow, etc. as required.  These are the base idempotent templates for resources & public/private code-libraries, written in Azure Bicep. 
The ultimate output is a fully operational cloud-resource group, sensibile file shares, key-vaults, monitoring, logging scaffold skeletons in TS & Python as well (the "c0re") which presents itself as an interactive filesytem/blob storage. 

# What is so Opionated? 
By subscribing to this pattern, an effort is made to obviate certain things.  It assumes the author will (ultimately) decide to end up using a combination of stateful logic, so it simplifies the interface to those by creating a unified command language that can be further build on.  There is a method to the madness, I assure you.  The patterns utilize serverless consumption plans whenever possible.  The plan is to eventually include complete VS code project files & plugin.    This assumes the developer(s) are using a three stage release model, "InnerLoop", "OuterLoop", "Production" each of those moving the data to the cloud and toward the public, no attempts are made .
